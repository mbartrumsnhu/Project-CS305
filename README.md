# Project-CS305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company that works in banking. They have many accounts from around the world. They are successful and they are looking to expand their security. The real issue is that the system has not been updated in a long time and it needs a way to keep information from clients and their workers secured and safe from a cyber attack. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
The area that I did the best in was looking up the best security and what we should implement to Artemis Financial . it is important to code securely because everyday we hear about a company having a cyber attack. This is horrible because client information is being shared on the dark web and it could be used for ID theft. This also hurts the company too because they will get sued, lose the ability to be able to create again, and may even serve time. When you have software security it just put an extra layer of security to keep your company safe and it should be monthly topics and help 
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The best part was trying to get into different ports. It is very hard to do at first but it can be very useful to keep certain people from certain accounts.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Increasing layers is adding an extra block from someone able to come in and steal information from the company. I believe next time I would look at the physical security and wonder how they handle that, and finally see if any of the system needs updated.
 How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I added to highest encryption that is best for the company with AES. While doing research it was the best to use that since it the oldest and hasn’t been cracked yet. Once i finished it I did a static test and a test to see if it was on the secure shell and the right encryption. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
YouTube has been a big help, but Springboot and sites that have great QA list would be something that I would honestly use. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show the encryption and the paperwork from this and show in detail of what i have done in research and my reward from it.
